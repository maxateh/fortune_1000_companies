This project analyzes data from the 2024 Fortune 1000 list to uncover insights about the top-performing companies. I focused on key metrics like revenue, profitability, logistics, and sales projections to understand what drives business success.

**Data Preparation (Excel)**
- Cleaned and organized the dataset for analysis.
- Removed irrelevant columns and updated market cap values.
- Ensured correct data types and saved the file as .xlsx for use in Power BI.

**Data Visualization (Power BI)**
Created a detailed, interactive dashboard with:
- Revenue & Profit by Company
- KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Assets, Companies, and Employees
- Companies by State
- Company Website & CEO
- Built a filter panel with slicers and a “Clear Filters” button for better user control.

**Outcome**
The final dashboard tells a compelling story of what makes Fortune 1000 companies successful and some business insights.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. Thanks for checking out my project! 😊
